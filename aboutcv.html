  <h1>RESUME</h1>
    <h2>Present – 2014</h2>
    <p>
      My recent move to Australia has been amazing. Adjusting to my new environment is taking time. But I know with hard work and dedication I can find a rewarding position that encourages growth and pushes me to new limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the move I have been recruited to work on some of Australia's top brands and their conjoining agencies.  Including but not exclusively Clemenger BBDO, Igloo and Sputnik Agency. </p>
    <p>
      However I am still on the lookout for a fulltime position where I can grow and explore new possibilities.
    </p>
    <h2>2013 – 2006 </h2>
    <p>
      During most of this time I was living and working in London UK. As a Graphic Designer and Animator. I was recruited to work with some of the city's top agencies. Including but not exclusively Ogilvy One, Satchi and AKQA, in industries ranging from Automotive, Cuisine, Media and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was kept very busy during this time, but managed to keep my eyes on the prize as I had set my sights on Australia. So I had to say good bye to the city where I was born.
    </p>
    <h2>2005 – 1997</h2>
    <p>
      After the completion of a Masters Degree in Advertising Design from AAU San Francisco. I stayed in SF and worked for a great many start-up companies that had grown with the birth of the Internet.  Including but not exclusively E-greetings, Quokka Sports and Freestyle Interactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was my introduction to working in the online space. I rose from Junior Designer to Art Director in a few short years and everything happened very quickly. Of course we all know what happened after that.
