      Hello! My name is Paul Reid and I am first and foremost a Graphic Designer. But with a passion for all things new and wonderful in Web Development.

      So when I am not thinking about layout, type or timing for animation sequences. You can often find me exploring Javascript consepts. Making games, hacking on SVGs or setting up a node enviroment. Over the years I have developed a healthy appetite for Javascript and generaly prefer the node way of doing things. I guess it harps back to the good old ActionScript 3 days. Anyway I like it. Which has worked out well. Many things that were before hard or impossible to do from the frontend are now possible. Thank you Javascript!

      I should mention HTML and CSS are part of my workflow as well. I wouldn't consider myself a high guru of the pre-compiler, but I use SCSS and like it well enough. Although it hasn't been my primary focus.

      Ok so with that said, I am not a developer. I come from a Graphic Design/ Creative Advertising background and am mostly self taught when it comes to coding Websites and Animations. This is not an impediment though. Actualy the opposite. With the current scale of change unless one posseses a DIY attitude it won't be long before things get stale and redundant.

      My professional career started in San Francisco during the dot com thing, early 90's. I had just graduated with a Masters degree in Advertising Design from AAU and was swiftly sucked into my first dot com flop, to be followed by a string of others. Or at least that's how it turned out, not my fault by the way. So you could say that although I was doing mostly Graphic Design work with a bit of Art Direction. I always had my finger in the code pie, even back then, and have been steadily building on it ever since.

      As far as definitions go, I guess I am a hybrid mash-up of creative and tech that goes back to the early days and I am just as confused as you are. But the great thing is we love it. And after all why shouldn't we. It's awesome and we are changing the world.
