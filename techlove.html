  <h1>BIKE AND BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
  <p>
    I love my bicycle. Not because it's technically sophisticated but rather because it's not. All I have to do is get on it and go. No licence, no fuel and no parking issues and you get to shed a few extra kilos while your about it.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's how I clear my head when the code gets to heavy or I just need to get some distance from the design I've been working on. Yes I love my bike, we've been together since the mid 90's and it goes where I go otherwise I doubt it would still be in my possession.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://blockchain.info/">Blockchain</a> is not part of my bike. Although it also has a chain. But is technically sophisticated. The Blockchain is a distributed ledger or database used in <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> which is a decentralised crypto currency. If you don't know what I am talking about I encourage you to <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4g1XFU8Gto">find out</a>. It has the potential to fundamentally change how we interact with each other and the  <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">world</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok first maybe I should mention that I don't actually own any Bitcoins. There are a few reasons for this. One I don't possess much money of any kind, fiat or otherwise, and two. My infatuation with Bitcoin and the Blockchain is more about what it promises for the future and less about what it is today.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am personally not very interested in amassing huge piles of cash, "he must be crazy". Possibly so but I like to envision a time where the Blockchain manages our collective impulse to store more than we need. I belief this can happen because ultimately most of us want to be trusted and to be seen as doing the right thing. With incentivisation it becomes even more powerful. Get rewarded for doing the right thing, when you feel like it. Now that is novel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imposed insecurities are nurtured and feed by our current centralised system, in order to maintain, well, order and control. Fine, it's done a wonderful job, but I doubt there is much argument that today's system no longer serves the needs of the people, or the planet. Zombie banks are making a huge mess out of the last remaining finite resources. Mass income inequality further deepens the divide and on and on.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what if we take away the insecurity. With Bitcoin this is theoretically possible, because we will always have enough. Why? Because we will always be able to make a valuable contribution that is recognised and trusted through the Blockchain. The incentive for corruption will fade, increasing the level of transparency, accountability and trust through out the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe then we can start to ease the assault on our base insecurities, that make us eat to much and become obese, or collect more than we will ever be able to spend in a life time. We need a way to lessen the isolation and fear that we currently entertain in our lives. Then we can reconnect with each other in a meaningful and fulfilling way again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok so that's the rant. Bitcoin and the Blockchain will save the planet by decentralising old locked in centralised structures. From our bank account, to how we reach consensus, in all facets of life. Not quite, or at least not yet, or probably not in my life time. But even if your a staunch believer in our current system you can't deny that we are living in interesting times whether we like it or not.
