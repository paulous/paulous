  <h1>WEB OF THINGS</h1>
  <p>
    So I though I would share some of what I am currently busying myself with, recent web related discoveries, quandaries, misgivings and future possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at what's going on in web development it's plain to see that we are far from any kind of equilibrium or levelling off point. Instead it's cumulatively changing more rapidly. Case in point the whole package management, bundler debate. It seems the industry has just come to terms with npm and Gulp, in favour of Grunt and Bower, when <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://webpack.github.io/">WebPack</a> comes along and changes it up again. Just one example of the constantly reshaping landscape Frontend development has to face.
  </p>
  <p>
    The end result of this is. Don't get sentimental about your process. It's going to change.
  </p>
  <h2>REACT.JS</h2>
  <p>
    So I have a fair grasp of Javascript basics and now it's time to take it to the next level and write more <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern/">modular</a>code. My current focus has been drawn to  <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript">Javascript design patterns</a> and looking into <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html">Facebooks React</a>. From my initial findings React seems more intuitive for a lowly Graphic Designer like myself to grok. Also JSX seems quite familiar and friendly. I am also drawn to the youthfulness of the the community, seems a little less crusty and more accessible for my not so linear mind. Anyway my feeling is that it will become increasingly more popular. Until of course the next best thing rolls around.
  </p>
  <h2>CSS EVOLVING</h2>
  <p>
    Working with Cascading Style Sheets has always been a mixed pleasure. Lacking the sophistication of Javascipt it's repetitive nature has never made it much fun. Of course it's great to be able to style pages and there is always JQuery etc, but that's Javascript. So pre-compilers like LESS or SASS. This has at least allowed for <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://alistapart.com/article/dry-ing-out-your-sass-mixins">DRY</a>er markup. I still think it has a way to go before it becomes truly efficient and user friendly. <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://scotch.io/demos/visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-flexbox-playground">Flex-Box</a> is a move in the right direction. Also projects like <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://www.getmdl.io/">Googles Material Design</a>, <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://yeticss.com/">Yetti</a> and <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://colourgarden.net/avalanche/">Avalanche</a> all bring different benefits and ease of use. Or for a more futuristic glance <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://gridstylesheets.org/">GSS</a> seems to patch some of the layout problems posed by traditional CSS. In any case today it's a fundamental necessity in any webified toolkit like it or not.
  </p>
  <h2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h2>
  <p>
    So I like to ponder where it's all going anyway and what's in store for us down the line. One of the most exciting projects I have come across recently would be <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>. It seems to have sparked of the next great move towards total platform independence. Forget Mac OS and PC Microsoft even Linux and say hello to your new OS that is made completely with HTML, CSS and Javascript and as such is completely customisable. Ok it isn't a thing, yet. But Electron looks to be the first to have the guts to bring such a thing around, for any device. I use the Atom IDE built with Electron and find it fast and mostly awesome. Another project that uses React, <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a>, and Electron is <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://www.nylas.com/n1">Nylas N1</a> stylish email client. Truly exiting times for customisation and modular based design.
