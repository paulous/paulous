  <h1>DARK PATTERNS IN UX</h1>
  <p>
    I don't really hate anything. Instead I like to think that I am a kind, compassionate human being. Concerned with bringing about positive change in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok maybe my chosen industry doesn't have the best track record sometimes. But, maybe that's why I choose it and maybe it's time we were more conscientious with our increasingly bewildered targeted audiences. I belife a new era of transparency and accountability is apon us and I for one am exited to grab the horns but not buy the bull.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the biggest misnomers I see today is "UX Expert". What is that? Is there such a thing? Maybe, but it isn't anything in particular. More it's a combination of many things and just like any complex mixture it doesn't always produce a palatable result. Case in point. <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://darkpatterns.org/what_is_a_dark_pattern/">Dark Patterns</a>. Yes they are smart, or at least smarter than the average user today, but look at what <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_psychology">reverse psychology</a> did for us 20 years ago. Like wise we will grow to understand what we currently are unaware of and vent our frustrations on those brands that employ these tactics.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will instead gravitate toward brands that consistently give us the greatest degree of intuitiveness and transparency. "It seemed like a good idea at the time", will echo down the UX fallacy for years to come. I will leave you with a quote from the guy who invented the term and remind you of an acronym that I was first introduced to in College and have tried to abide by since. <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">K.I.S.S</a>.

  <h3>
    I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with the system including industrial design graphics, the interface, the physical interaction and the manual. Since then the term has spread widely, so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning.<br>
