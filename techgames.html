  <h1>PLAY MY GAME</h1>
  <p>
    I am not much of a gamer. But I like games. Games are part of everything we do. Just another problem to be solved. Except with a game you get to choose what flavour of problem and that is based on your own bias for what problems you enjoy.

    Well as a creative who has been trained to think in terms of Marketing and Advertising principles. I can't help be drawn to the seductive possibilities game design offers. Platform games are out of my reach at this point. So instead I gravitate towards browser style games and try to keep an ear to the ground when new advances are realised. I believe it is only a matter of time before they merge.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of these advances is <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="http://readwrite.com/2015/03/17/asm-js-games-pros-and-cons">ASM</a> a pre-compiled subset of Javascript that runs like native C code in the browser. Very cool, but still a bit advanced for me. The open sourcing of the <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://developer.cdn.mozilla.net/media/uploads/demos/a/z/azakai/3baf4ad7e600cbda06ec46efec5ec3b8/bananabread_1424465008_demo_package/index.html">Unreal Engine</a> and projects like <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Emsripten</a> start to bring it all a lot closer.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the mean time I have been busying myself with less complex frameworks and 2D experiences using <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a>. There are many Javascript game frameworks out there but I initially choose to focus on <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://phaser.io">Phaser</a>, as it closely resembles Adobe Flash, which I am used to working with and has a good selection of tools to get the job done. They haven't modularised it yet but I think that will be coming soon.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" class="a-body" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> is also another interesting offering as they have recently brought webGL rendering to there engine allowing for non plug-in based games to be played in the browser. Anyway you can checkout the first game I made with Phaser above and another freelance project that is unskinned but still playable. I am currently working on another larger game in my spare time, but because of it's size I have been side tracked by learning how to better manage my code through modularisation.
